This is Asti. 

## About

This is mostly a bunch of notes, how-tos, internet wisdom, and gotchas, which originally were kept in Trello and Dropbox.  Some of the things are notes to myself, or future intrepid explorers.

And hopefully some of the trouble I went through will help a future engineer.

I like building things at very low levels, and at very high levels.
Although I'll take troubleshooting software any day over troubleshooting electronics though.

I try to help out on the `f#` and `system.reactive` tags on Stackoverflow from time to time.
