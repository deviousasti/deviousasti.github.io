      <description>Sometimes, you have a small run of boards, and you need to combine the BOM for them, to know how much to order or check against your inventory. This is especially needed when a lot of designs share parts, and it is tedious to combine them by hand.
Get csv-merge
Step 1 Export your BOM files as CSV (Comma Separated Values).
Check if most of your BOMs have the same header - the order does not matter, just the name.</description>
